This fork is update https://github.com/ericliang/rabbitmq-xmpp for support ejabberd 14.07.

This project was initially forked from http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-xmpp/, which was released by Tony Garnock-Jones http://www.lshift.net/blog/2008/07/01/rabbitmq-xmpp-gateway-released.

This project is created for corresponding with the latest ejabberd and rabbitmq-server, and for some customizations which will list in README.CUSTOMIZED. Anyway, the primary document is worth reading http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-xmpp/raw-file/default/doc/index.html.


To install this module, you should:

1 specify the ejabberd dir, which will default to /usr/loca/ejabberd if not set:

    make EJABBERD_DIR=[/path/to/ejabberd]

2.1 add the module dir to ejabberdctl.cfg:
    
    ERL_OPTIONS="-pa [/path/to/rabbitmq-xmpp]/ebin"

or 

2.2 copy the beam files to ejabberd ebin directory, in which case you will profit from the ejabberd_update function.
